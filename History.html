<b><u> General History </b></u>
</h2>
<p>
The history of Inverurie goes well beyond 1000 years.
Surrounding this town are two rivers: the river don and the river urie.
The place where the two rivers meet is calledthe bass and was famously used as a base by Robert The Bruce.
Nowadays the bass is just a cemetary.
Inverurie grew at a steady rate with the town becoming an offical burgh in the year 1195.
By 1797 there was a bridge over the river don which linked the town with a place called Port Elphinstone

<h2>
<b><u> The first battle of Inverurie (Battle of Barra) </b></u> 
</h2>
<p>
The battle of Inverurie occured in May of 1308. It was just a small part of the scottish independence woars.
This was a harsh war between Robert the Bruce against John Comyn, The Earl of Buchan
At this time Robert the Bruce was travelling from the south to the north through Scotland taking out all his enemies one by one the Earl of Buchan.
He had at least an army of 3000 men in his following. It was thought Buchan could not stand up to this but was somewhat saved when Robert the Bruce took ill.
Lots of Bruce's army dissapeared over his time of illness leaving no more than 700 men.
Roberts Army made camp in Inverurie while Buchan prepared his men for battle. An uncoodrinted attack and his lack of skills as a commander put him at a disadvantage.
On the 23rd of May, Buchans army stormed into battle, right into the streets of Inverurie.
Although initially winning due to the element of surprise, his army was not well prepared.
It is said that the appearence of Bruce at the Barra Hill  may have lead the rest of Buchan's army to flee
but no doubt Robert The Bruce was victorious on that day.

<b><u> The second battle of Inverurie </b></u>
</h2>
<p>
This battle of Inverurie took place on the 23rd of december of the year 1745. This battle was between those who supported King Charles Stuart (known as jacobites) and his right to rule,
and those who were in support of William of Orange (and the british government) who was currently on the throne.
A jacobite known as Lord Lewis Gordon put together a large force but created conflict with his brother Cosmo George Gordon,
who supported the other side. A man called John Cambell gave instructions to multiple clan chiefs to stop Lewis raising any larger of an army.
Lord Lewis knew of this rising opposition and went to Aberdeen to get the support of clans who agreed with his clause.
The clan leader of Clan Mcleod, Norman McLeod was the man who had is clan resign within Inverurie.
Lewis Gordon moved against him from the west side of Inverurie. A battle began. The battle ended with MacLeod in defeat,
after being pushed back and fleeing to the town of Elgin. Many of his men were also taken prisoner. It was said during this retreat the battle still occured and that as moonlight fell
the MacLeod army fought their way out.
