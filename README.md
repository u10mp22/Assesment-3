# Assesment-3 Michael Pollard 52210451
For this assesment I made a website about inverurie. The choice of colours for each page were chosen as they made the text clear to read.
The colour of blue for the navigation bar and yellow for some of the pages were to represent one of the things Inverurie is known for the academy. Blue and yellow are on the badge for the academy.
Challanges I faced when making this website were getting the navigation bar to work efficiently which I overcame by reading some of the tutorials online about website nagivation.
There was also issues with splitting the third page about things to do into two columns which I eventually worked out.
